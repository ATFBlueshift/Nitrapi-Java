A Java-Library that makes the communication with the Nitrapi simpler.
<p>
    You create a new Nitrapi instance and pass the access_token you generated for the user to it.
<p>
    Every call on this api can throw a NitrapiHttpException when there is a problem connection to the api (e.g. the pc
    has no internet connection)
    and a NitrapiErrorException if there is a problem using the api (e.g. not enough permissions)
